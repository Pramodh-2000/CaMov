Summary:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have completed the task that you assigned to me regarding the camera animation script in Unity. Based on my understanding of the requirements, I have written the CameraController.cs and RuntimeAnimatorControllerScript.cs scripts to achieve the desired camera movement and rotation around a target position with speed and distance parameters.

CaMov:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have named the project CaMov and have built executable files for Windows, Mac, Linux, and WebGL.

To use the application, simply run the CaMov executable file on your device. The application will load up, and you can use the camera to view and navigate around the target object. The camera will rotate around the target position based on the distance and rotation speed parameters set in the script.

The CameraController.cs script defines a camera movement and rotation behavior that is applied to a specified target position and distance from the ground. The script uses input from the user to adjust the speed of the camera's rotation around the target position. The RuntimeAnimatorControllerScript.cs script applies this camera behavior to a specified game object and ensures that the camera movement and rotation are synchronized with the movement of the game object.

To use the application that I have built, you can simply run the Unity project and play the scene. The camera will rotate around the target position with the speed and distance parameters that you have specified, and will follow the movement of the game object in the scene.

Please let me know if this is what you had in mind for the task, or if there are any additional features or improvements that you would like me to add.

Best regards,
Aditya Pramodh.
